# Greed
Socrates once said he who is not contented with what he has, would not be contented with what he would like to have, you will always remember this talk while playing greed game because
Greed is a game in which the player seeks to gather as many falling gems as possible. The game continues as long as the player wants more! Rules: Greed is played according to the following rules. Gems(*) and rocks (0) randomly appear and fall from the top of the screen. The player (#) can move left or right along the bottom of the screen. If the player touches a gem they earn a point. If the player touches a rock they lose a point. Gems and rocks are removed when the player touches them. The game continues until the player closes the window.
